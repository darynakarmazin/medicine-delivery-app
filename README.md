Medicine Delivery app. Web application where users can order medicines delivery. The Medicine Delivery app consist of two pages: the shops page and the shopping cart page. 

The shops page where users can choose a drug store, then add medicines to the cart (data from the database MongoDB)

The shopping cart page where the user can check all added products, remove some of them or change the count. And add an email, a phone number, and an address (in inputs)

The order is saved in the database after the user clicks the “submit” button.

Also app included:
- the ability to sort medicines by price;
- the ability to mark medicines as favorites;
- The cart saving in local storage.

Notes:

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the backend server part of the application is hosted at a free rate on render.com and the first response after a long period of non-interaction can take up to 1-5 minutes.
